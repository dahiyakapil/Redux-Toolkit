In store there are three main things 
1. State
    // creating store
    const state = createState(reducer)

2. Reducer ---> Simple function having two params(state, action)...... Reducer will always return a state
    It takes previous state and add some action to it 
    Like in example of bank where we want to add deposit $100.
    in state -> preivious state = $200 
    action -> deposit = $100
    so the reducer function return a new state = $200 + $100 = $300

    function reducer(state, action) {
        return state
    }


3. Dispatch --> fucntion
